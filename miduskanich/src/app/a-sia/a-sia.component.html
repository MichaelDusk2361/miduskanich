<h1>Motivation and Background</h1>
<p>
  As part of the subject <i>Innovation Lab</i> we had to work on a chosen
  project in groups of five. The project we chose concerns itself with
  <a target="_blank" href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soziale_Impulsanalyse">
    <i>social impulse analysis</i>
  </a>
  , and will run over the course of three semesters. I developed a major part of
  this application and am also project manager, overseeing development and
  requirements engineering.
</p>
<p>
  Social impulse analysis is all about recording, visualizing, and evaluating
  social connections within a group. A software developed in 2010 already
  provides a basis for this project:

<p>
  As it turned out, the software <i>A-SIA</i>, became outdated, leading to the
  main task: Redesigning the frontend with a modern framework, as well as
  outsourcing resource heavy computation to a server-side application.
</p>
<h2>What is the theoretical background of this app?</h2>
<p>
  A-SIA was a software for modeling teams and social networks. The tool
  supported the recording of the influencing structures, which could either be
  entered manually or be automatically generated from answered questionnaires.
  The relationship patterns collected in this way were graphically displayed and
  support the processing of social and group dynamic phenomena in teams.
  Furthermore, it simulated What-If scenarios, visualizing group dynamic
  effects.
</p>
<h2>Why does it have to be reworked?</h2>
<p>
  A-SIA was developed with Microsoft Silverlight, now unsuitable for modern app
  development. Moreover, a lot of computation is done client-side. A visual
  refactoring, as well as a redistribution of server-side calculation is
  required.
</p>
<h2>Who is the target audience / customer?</h2>
<p>
  A-SIA was used by a multitude of different companies. This project, however,
  does not necessarily need to be deployment ready with multiple pricing
  options. The focus lies on a well-documented and future-proof web application.
</p>
<h2>What are the main features of the application?</h2>
<p>
  Visualizing a sociogram: A sociogram consists of actors and relations. Those
  will have to be created manually (and possibly generated via an auto generated
  form) within a user interface, which is displayed as an undirected graph.
  Trust, mistrust, irritation, insistency and reflection are metrics that can be
  helpful for a more descriptive display. Different arrangements and filtering
  options should be available.
</p>
<p>
  Simulation: The prominent premise of this application is, that it can simulate
  social dynamics. For example, an actor can be selected to propose an idea.
  Then, the user of the software can step through the simulation. The algorithm
  for this simulation will be provided.
</p>
<p>
  Backend: Data (sociograms) can be stored and loaded from a database.
  Furthermore, the computation will be done server-side, reducing the load on
  the client.
</p>
<h2>What are non-targets of this project?</h2>
<p>Improving the simulation algorithm.</p>
<p>A mobile first approach.</p>
<p>Keeping the calculation client-side.</p>
<h1>Visual prototyping</h1>
<p>
  In my opinion, visual prototyping is the best way to communicate with your
  client which requirements are expected, and how they are to be implemented. I
  made mockups of large parts of the application in

  Parallel to designing the user interface, we also defined and estimated User
  Stories.

<h2>Architecture</h2>
<h3>Environment, Frameworks and Tools</h3>
<p>
  This project requires a full stack development. As the project might be
  expanded in the future, it must be well documented.
</p>
<b>Frontend</b>
<ul>
  <li>Angular</li>
  <li>Jasmin / Karma</li>
  <li>Compodoc</li>
  <li>SCSS</li>
</ul>

<p>
  As there already exists prior knowledge with the MEAN stack, Angular was
  chosen as a frontend Framework. Angular natively includes Jasmin and Karma,
  being the obvious choice for unit testing. For automatic code documentation,
  Compodoc was chosen – a popular open source, Angular-friendly tool.
</p>
<b>Backend</b>
<ul>
  <li>ASP.NET</li>
  <li>Neo4J</li>
  <li>Docker and docker compose</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We are already familiar with ASP.NET, so we are using it to build the REST
  api. As there will be a lot of calculations and processing related to graphs,
  a graph database is the obvious choice. Neo4J provides a free and easy to use
  community edition. Docker and Docker compose is suitable as there are multiple
  deployment targets, and because it is easier to use, document, and understand
  than manual deployment.
</p>
<b>Collaboration & Tooling</b>
<ul>
  <li>ALM - Azure DevOps</li>
  <li>Communication - Zoom, Discord</li>
  <li>VC - Azure DevOps (Snapshot available on GitHub)</li>
  <li>Mockups - Figma</li>
  <li>Docker (compose) for deployment</li>
</ul>
<h3>System Description</h3>

<b>Components</b>
<p>
  Our deployment runs through docker compose. The communication between
  components works through external docker volumes, and the auto generated
  network. SSL certificates are authored by lets-encrypt. Our deployment builds
  on evgeniy-khist’s auto TLS generation and renewal repository.
</p>
<p>The deployment structure is split into following components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Nginx reverse proxy
    <ul>
      <li>
        The reverse proxy forwards requests to the statically served frontend or
        asp.net backend.
      </li>
      <li>
        The reverse proxy does https termination (so we can use http behind the
        proxy, simplifying the whole process)
      </li>
      <li>
        The main issue that usually arises with full stack docker deployments is
        easy management of https. It’s a bit of a chicken and egg problem.
        Without a ssl certificate, we can’t be reached by lets-encrypt (due to
        nginx not starting), but without lets-encrypt we can’t get proper ssl
        certificates. There are many public repositories available online, that
        try to solve this issue. It basically works by running a shell script,
        that inspects the config.env file and generated dummy ssl certificates
        for every defined domain.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Certbot
    <ul>
      <li>
        Certbot is a tool that provides ssl certificates, default configurations
        and auto renewal of ssl certificates.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Cron
    <ul>
      <li>
        A cron job that checks daily for renewal of ssl certificates, and
        triggers certbot if it is time to do so.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    a-sia-backend
    <ul>
      <li>
        An ASP.NET backend that handles all requests by the frontend, and
        further communicates with the neo4j database.
      </li>
      <li>
        The dockerfile building this service can be found at /src/A-SIA2WebAPI
      </li>
      <li>
        The docker image is being pulled from a docker repository, in this case
        Docker hub. This enables easy deployment through the pipeline.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    a-sia-frontend
    <ul>
      <li>
        A nginx server that statically serves the build output from angular.
      </li>
      <li>
        The static content is copied into the docker image when running the
        dockerfile found at /src/A-SIA2FrontendAngular, which is why we don’t
        need any extra docker volumes.
      </li>
      <li>
        This could also have been served directly from the reverse proxy, but
        this way it is more flexible and expandable – although at the cost of
        neglectable milliseconds latency.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Neo4j
    <ul>
      <li>The Graph database holding our data.</li>
      <li>
        The database runs independent of the reverse proxy, as it uses different
        ports, and doesn’t utilize https. Calls from the backend to the database
        and back never leave the local network.
      </li>
      <li>It can also be accessed through a browser connection</li>
      <li>
        We are using the bolt protocol, the username and password are stored in
        the db.env file, given the password wasn’t changed after running the
        database for the first time.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<b>Routes</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    &lt;domain&gt;.com:7474/browser
    <ul>
      <li>
        Leads to the neo4j browser, which is used to interface with our database
        remotely. It runs over http, which is why your browser might warn you.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    &lt;domain&gt;.com:7687
    <ul>
      <li>
        The connection we are using to connect directly to the database, for
        example from asp.net – we are using the bolt protocol.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    api.&lt;domain&gt;.com:443
    <ul>
      <li>The domain to our backend, mainly called by our frontend.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    api.&lt;domain&gt;.com:443/swagger
    <ul>
      <li>
        A swagger page of our domain – it lists all endpoints and data models
        and is especially useful for quick requests and debugging.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    a-sia.&lt;domain&gt;.com:443
    <ul>
      <li>
        The frontend, by which users access the software. Realistically it will
        be configured to run under &lt;domain&gt;.com:443 instead of
        a-sia.&lt;domain&gt;.com:443.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
